# `src/history/` — Game History Recorder

This module persists every cleanly-ended mjai game to a stable, frontend-readable
store. The on-disk shape (under `<config_root>/history/`) is:

```
history/
  index.jsonl              # one JSON-encoded GameRecord per line, append-only
  games/
    <ulid>.mjai.jsonl      # full event stream for that record
```

`<ulid>` is a [ULID](https://github.com/ulid/spec) generated at finalisation
time — lexicographically sortable by start time, doubles as the filename stem.

## Pipeline

```
                    ┌──────────────┐
   MjaiBus  ──────▶ │  recorder::  │ ──▶ HistoryStore.append() ──▶ index.jsonl
                    │  drive_loop  │                                games/<id>.mjai.jsonl
                    └──────────────┘
                            │
                            ▼
                       HistoryBus  ──▶  ipc forwarder  ──▶  "history-recorded" Tauri event
```

A `RecorderState` machine buffers events between `StartGame` and a confirmed
`EndGame`. On a Mahjong Soul reconnect to the same table it retains completed
rounds and replaces the server-restored copy of the current round. A different
next game, explicit server termination, or shutdown drops the incomplete
buffer. A first mid-game restoration can persist the rounds actually obtained
once the game ends; its record has `partial: true`, appears as a partial capture
in the UI, and is excluded from complete-game placement and PT statistics. Old
records without this field default to complete.

## Modules

- **`aggregator.rs`** — Pure function `aggregate(events, ...) -> Option<GameRecord>`.
  Ports the `Stat::from_game` aggregator from Mortal's `libriichi`. It walks
  `Reach`/`ReachAccepted`/`Hora`/`Ryukyoku` deltas for statistics, prefers a
  platform's authoritative final standings when supplied, and otherwise
  normalises totals to 100k (4p) / 105k (3p). Stat counts mirror `Stat`'s field
  set, scoped to one game.
- **`store.rs`** — `HistoryStore` (JSONL append-only index + per-game event
  files). Single mutex serialises writes; reads are lock-free (re-open).
- **`recorder.rs`** — `drive_loop(store, history_bus, platform, mjai_rx)`. The
  long-running task spawned in `lib.rs::run`.

## Runtime platform

Only Majsoul and Tenhou run. The recorder receives the selected platform through its shared platform slot; match identity comes from StartGame. Other old enum labels remain read compatibility only. Platform switching must invalidate old capture and action context without rewriting stored files.

## Adding a new GameStats field

1. Add the field to `crate::schema::history::GameStats` (default-initialised
   to keep deserialisation backward-compatible with old index lines).
2. Update `aggregator.rs` to populate it.
3. Mirror in the frontend `types/history.ts`, `lib/ptCalc.ts` (if it affects
   PT), and `components/history/StatsTable.tsx` (display).
4. Older `index.jsonl` lines will deserialise with the new field defaulting;
   no migration step is required so long as the new field has a `Default`.

## Match identity (`GameRecord.match_info`)

`schema::history::MatchInfo` is a platform-tagged enum carrying the raw room
/ rank-lobby ids and the platform's own game (paifu) id — e.g. Majsoul
`mode_id` + `game_uuid`, Tenhou `<GO type>` bitfield + log id. Bridges attach
it to `StartGame.game_meta` (a `#[serde(skip)]` field, so mjai logs and the
local inference stream never sees it) and the aggregator copies it into the record.

Rules of the road:

- Store **raw platform values**; label mapping lives in the frontend
  (`frontend/src/lib/matchInfo.ts` + `history.room.*` locale keys) so an
  unknown id shows as a number instead of a wrong name.
- Every field is `Option` + `#[serde(default)]` — bridges fill what their
  wire carried, old index lines deserialise with `match_info: None`.
- To extend: add fields/variants in `schema/history.rs`, fill them in the
  bridge's StartGame emission, mirror in `frontend/src/types.ts`.

## Adding a filter dimension

1. Add the field to `HistoryFilter` (in `schema/history.rs`).
2. Update `HistoryFilter::matches`.
3. Add the corresponding form control in `frontend/src/routes/History.tsx`.

## Don't

- Don't backfill from `<log_dir>/majsoul/*.mjai.jsonl` — those are bridge debug
  logs and may include incomplete / duplicated streams. The history store is
  populated *only* by the live recorder.
- Don't write into `<log_dir>` from this module — keep the two surfaces
  decoupled.
